09/06/2011 Version 0.1

Taken from http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/kindle/index.php#standalone-kindle-terminal
With a bug-fix from mobileread.com and a patch to make it fullscreen.

Thanks to those, especially luigi.

At initial commit the following changes have been made:

	-The http terminal code removed
	-Hack to make it run a login shell (pull in profile etc)

First steps TODO:
	-accept path to config files as arguments to make /bin /etc structure possible
	-improve terminal support, specifically wrapping.
	-Pull in supporting code, screen, corkscrew, plink and/or ssh and/or working dbclient, profile changes init script
	-sshagent
	

Down the road:
	-separate the terminal from launchpad, i.e. run from seperate launchpad.
	-package.
